Monoalpha by Toby Govin-Fowler

Version 1.0.1

Monoalpha is a simple monoalphabetic cipher program. It can be used to generate generate code
alphabets, as well as encrypting, and decrypting text. It supports caesar shift,
ROT13, affine, atbash, and keyword ciphers. It can also encrypt and decrypt based
on your own code alphabets.

Commands (words in [square brackets] indicate arguments)
